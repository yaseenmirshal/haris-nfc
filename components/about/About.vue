            <p>
              I am a San francisco-based product designer with a focus on web
              design, illustration, a visual development. I have a diverse range
              of experience having worked across various fields and industries.

              Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text.
              It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC,
              making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin
              professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of
              the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum
              passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical
              literature, discovered the undoubtable source.
